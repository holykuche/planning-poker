### Migration to microservices isn't done yet

#### Finished microservices:
* in-memory-db

#### Unfinished microservices:
* poker (left to make compatibility with RabbitMQ or Kafka)
* telegram (left to make compatibility with RabbitMQ or Kafka, create some implementations)

##### Also need to finally configure Docker

***
This is my first try at using microservice architecture, Docker, gRPC and RabbitMQ/Kafka. Just for studying.
