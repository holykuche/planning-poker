### Migration to microservices isn't done yet

#### Finished microservices:
* in-memory-db

#### Unfinished microservices:
* poker (it left to make compatibility with Kafka and make migration layer reusable between microservices)
* telegram (it left to make compatibility with Kafka, make migration layer reusable between microservices, create some implementations, fix tests)

##### Also, it needs to finally configure Docker

***
It's my first try to use microservice architecture, Docker, gRPC and Kafka. Just for studying.
